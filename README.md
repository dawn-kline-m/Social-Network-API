## Description

This challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. Express.js will be used for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 

## User Specifications

AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Functionality

GIVEN a social network API:

When the user enters the command to invoke the application, the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.

When the user opens the API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

When the user tests the API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, the user is able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in the database.

When the user tests API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, the user is able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list.

## Mock Up

The following animations show examples of the application's API routes being tested in Insomnia.

The following animation shows GET routes to return all users and all thoughts being tested in Insomnia:

The following animation shows GET routes to return a single user and a single thought being tested in Insomnia:

The following animation shows the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users being tested in Insomnia:

In addition to this, your walkthrough video should show the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

The following animation shows the POST and DELETE routes for a user’s friend list being tested in Insomnia:

In addition to this, your walkthrough video should show the POST and DELETE routes for reactions to thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

## Getting Started

Be sure to have MongoDB installed on your machine. Follow the [MongoDB installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) to install MongoDB locally.

Use the following guidelines to set up your models and API routes:

### Models

**User**:

* `username`
  * String
  * Unique
  * Required
  * Trimmed

* `email`
  * String
  * Required
  * Unique
  * Must match a valid email address (look into Mongoose's matching validation)

* `thoughts`
  * Array of `_id` values referencing the `Thought` model

* `friends`
  * Array of `_id` values referencing the `User` model (self-reference)

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `friendCount` that retrieves the length of the user's `friends` array field on query.

---

**Thought**:

* `thoughtText`
  * String
  * Required
  * Must be between 1 and 280 characters

* `createdAt`
  * Date
  * Set default value to the current timestamp
  * Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

* `username` (The user that created this thought)
  * String
  * Required

* `reactions` (These are like replies)
  * Array of nested documents created with the `reactionSchema`

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `reactionCount` that retrieves the length of the thought's `reactions` array field on query.

---

**Reaction** (SCHEMA ONLY)

* `reactionId`
  * Use Mongoose's ObjectId data type
  * Default value is set to a new ObjectId

* `reactionBody`
  * String
  * Required
  * 280 character maximum

* `username`
  * String
  * Required

* `createdAt`
  * Date
  * Set default value to the current timestamp
  * Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

**Schema Settings**:

This will not be a model, but rather will be used as the `reaction` field's subdocument schema in the `Thought` model.

### API Routes

**`/api/users`**

* `GET` all users

* `GET` a single user by its `_id` and populated thought and friend data

* `POST` a new user:

```json
// example data
{
  "username": "lernantino",
  "email": "lernantino@gmail.com"
}
```

* `PUT` to update a user by its `_id`

* `DELETE` to remove user by its `_id`

**BONUS**: Remove a user's associated thoughts when deleted.

---

**`/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId`**

* `POST` to add a new friend to a user's friend list

* `DELETE` to remove a friend from a user's friend list

---

**`/api/thoughts`**

* `GET` to get all thoughts

* `GET` to get a single thought by its `_id`

* `POST` to create a new thought (don't forget to push the created thought's `_id` to the associated user's `thoughts` array field)

```json
// example data
{
  "thoughtText": "Here's a cool thought...",
  "username": "lernantino",
  "userId": "5edff358a0fcb779aa7b118b"
}
```

* `PUT` to update a thought by its `_id`

* `DELETE` to remove a thought by its `_id`

---

**`/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions`**

* `POST` to create a reaction stored in a single thought's `reactions` array field

* `DELETE` to pull and remove a reaction by the reaction's `reactionId` value


### Walkthrough Video:

* A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the social media API must be submitted, and a link to the video should be included in your README file.

  * The walkthrough video must show all of the technical acceptance criteria being met.

  * The walkthrough video must demonstrate how to start the application’s server.

  * The walkthrough video must demonstrate GET routes for all users and all thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

  * The walkthrough video must demonstrate GET routes for a single user and a single thought being tested in Insomnia.

  * The walkthrough video must demonstrate POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users and thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

  * Walkthrough video must demonstrate POST and DELETE routes for a user’s friend list being tested in Insomnia.

  * Walkthrough video must demonstrate POST and DELETE routes for reactions to thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

Endpoints:
GET /api/users - get all users
